## Get data
This code is used to write the CMIP data to the WPS intermediate file. The data used in this programe is the MPI-HR_ECSM,  the required variables are as follows:

| **v_name** | **wrf_name** | **units** | **dim** | **desc**                | **notes** |
|------------|--------------|-----------|---------|-------------------------|-----------|

The data in "expamle" folder have the data between 2050-2055 and you can directly run with the code.

## Data handel
The `MPI-ESCM-HR-handel* .sh` are the bash scripts used to handle the CMIP data to specific format. e.g, When you enter the command:
``
bash MPI-ESCM-HR-handle2d.sh 20501003 20500104
``
then you can get files named :varname_2050-01-03_hours.nc

the `merge.sh` is used to merge all 2d and 3d files for convenience.

## Regrid and write WPS intermediate file

After run the `merge.sh`,you can nc files :2D_MPI_HR* and 3D_MPI_HR*
move them to same foler and run the write_wrf_int*ncl files repectively. The CMIP data will converted to the WPS intermediate file successfully.
